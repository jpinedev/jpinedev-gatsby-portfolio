Your privacy is important to me. It is my, Jacob Pine, policy to respect your privacy. Rather than collecting information about you, my portfolio is to help you learn more about me and my experience. Subsequently, I do not collect any data of those who visit my portfolio.

My website may link to external sites that are not operated by me. Please be aware that I have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.

This policy is effective as of 22 September 2022.
