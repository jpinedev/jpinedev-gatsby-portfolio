I would most like to gain experience developing multiplayer games and tools to expedite game creation.\nIn my free time, I love to go biking, listen to music, toss a frisbee, and play sports games. Some of my favorite sports games are Rocket League, Mario Tennis Aces, and Mario Super Sluggers. I also enjoy other games like Jedi Survivor, Hunt: Showdown, and Factorio.",
